# Buyer’s Premium

## Background

When an artwork is sold at auction, the fee the winning bidder must pay to the auction house is primarily comprised of the sum of the hammer price and buyer’s premium. Auction houses explain the extra buyer’s premium charge as necessary to cover administrative costs. They therefore keep the resulting revenue for themselves rather than share it with the seller.

Calculating the buyer’s premium is useful to be able to determine the underlying hammer price when only the sum of the buyer’s premium and the hammer price is known. Or, conversely, to determine the sum of the two given the hammer price.

Buyer’s premium is a percentage of the hammer price. However, it is not always a flat percentage. For example, an auction house might charge 25% premium up to $100,000, 20% from $100,001 to $2,000,000, and 10% to the remainder. That means that if a work has a hammer price of $120,000 the buyer’s premium will be $29,000 (0.25 * 100,000 + 0.2 * 20,000). The percentages used to calculate buyer’s premium depend on the auction house, the date of the auction, and the local currency of the auction venue.
